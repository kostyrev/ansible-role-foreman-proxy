foreman-proxy
=========
[DEPRECATED] Please use new version of [foreman role](https://github.com/kostyrevaa/ansible-role-foreman) instead.

An Ansible role for installing a foreman-proxy on RHEL/CentOS 6/7.

I use it to install foreman-proxy on plain http and so this role doesn't configures SSL but PRs are welcomed.

This role only manages foreman-proxy configuration and DOESN'T configure:

- TFTP server
- DHCP server
- DNS server

## Requirements

- SELinux is expected to be enabled.
